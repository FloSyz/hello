CLI commands for Github

git clone <url>
To copy the complete content of the repository in the current folder locally

git add <filename>
Keep track of a file. This file will be saved next time I make a commit
We don't want to save all files when we commit but also the tracked files.

git commit -m "message"
To save a snapshot of the current repository. 
Message says something about what we saved. This is only note for ourselves.
Easier to keep track of versions.
Attention: the content is not pushed yet to github, we need git push for that

This is a combination of git add step and git commit step.
The commit does not push changes to main in github.
The final step to push the commit is git push

allows to pull last version of files on Github to update the local file
